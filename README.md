This project implements a *Web-server* as a part of understanding Computer Networks courseware concepts. The code is intended to be clean albeit the name :)

## Basic Understanding
This project aims to understand how the actual web-server works; by implementing some of the server-side functionalities. The server uses HTTP protocol for client-server communication. Any web-browser can be used as a client.

### Working
The project provides TODO lists application.
```
cd src; python3 server.py
```
**NOTE**: Currently, the server can implement GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, DELETE methods ]

### Future Tasks
> 1. Client cache
> 2. Log implementations
> 3. exploring Pacman:)
